==============================================
       iSpeech plugins for Asterisk
==============================================

These plugins provide access to iSpeech Text To Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition
services making them available for use with Asterisk PBX.
http://www.ispeech.org/

------------
Requirements
------------
Perl          The Perl Programming Language
perl-libwww   The World-Wide Web library for Perl
IO-Socket-SSL Perl module that implements an interface to SSL sockets.

Internet access in order to contact google and get the speech data.
** Optional**
speex         patent-free audio compression format designed for speech.

------------
Installation
------------
To install copy ispeech-asr.agi and ispeech-tts.agi to your agi-bin directory.
Usually this is /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/
To make sure check your /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf file

-----
Usage
-----

  agi(ispeech-tts.agi,"text",[voice],[intkey],[speed]):
This will invoke the iSpeech TTS engine, render the text string to speech and play it
back to the user. If 'intkey' is set the script will wait for user input.
Any given interrupt keys will cause the playback to immediately terminate and
the dialplan to proceed to the matching extension (this is mainly for use in IVR,
see README for examples). If 'speed' is set the speech rate is altered by that factor.


  agi(ispeech-asr.agi,[lang],[freeform],[model],[timeout],[intkey],[NOBEEP]):
Records from the current channel untill 3 seconds of silence are detected
(this can be set by the user by the 'timeout' argument, -1 for no timeout) or the
interrupt key (# by default) is pressed. If NOBEEP is set, no beep sound is played
back to the user to indicate the start of the recording. For 'freeform' and 'model'
please refer to the ispeech API manual. 'freeform' defaults to 3 (Normal speech)
The recorded sound is send over to iSpeech ASR service and the
returned text string is assigned as the value of the channel variable 'utterance'.

The script sets the following channel variables:
status     : Return status. 0 means success, non zero values indicate different errors.
utterance  : The generated text string.
confidence : A value between 0 and 1 indicating how 'confident' the recognition engine
    feels about the result. Values bigger than 0.90 usually mean that the
    resulted text is correct.
